== Description ==

The plugin adds a fancy drag and drop (or click on mobile and tablets) captcha field to specific forms you choose by inserting the tag, classname or for example id as a selector and a form tag as to where the captcha should be displayed. The plugin is mainly based on javascript and jQuery and is absolutely random in it's functionality. The plugin is also compatible for tablets and smartphones on wich you cannot drag and drop. On those you just click ... Ps: the screenshots are in Dutch but the base plugin language is English.
